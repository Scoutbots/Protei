## Goal

In creating a segmented, articulated hull, we began with our design constraints of a 40cm x 250cm hull and asked the following questions:

how much should it articulate?

how shall we pattern it?

Molly and Roberto worked out the articulation limits using images and studies of fish turning, and cut some scale panels out of masonite.

Mathew and Logan began working on the curvature and hull shape. The foam we're building from is 5cm thick, so we built a scale model of the hull at 1/5 scale, carved until smoothe.  then we measured the hull, and scaled up the different layers of foam onto a large, single sheet of paper.

We then layed in the articulation sections onto our single sheet of paper, and made patterns for each piece of foam we must cut.  Tomorrow we'll take delivery on the foam, and start cutting.

**15/6/2011**

Today we took the patterns that had been made yesterday and traced them onto foam blocks we bought this morning. We cut the foam and assembled and glued the blocks together. The next steps are carving (sanding) the hull to make it smooth, and inserting PVC strips between the segments in order to create flexible articulation shapes. This hull can serve as a testing bed for different articulation methods, including hydraulic bladders, hydraulic cylinders, and cable pulled.
