## Observation

### Test report

- Wind condition : 8 knots gusts, mostly no wind
- Current condition : .5 to 1 knots
- Wave height : max 20 cm, high frequency, disorganised 3d waves



## Evaluation

### Overall

- Not very successful. Irregular low wind conditions. Test got disturbed by ferries.
- The boat is hard to maneuver and recover, pull off the water / carry around
- The currents were often faster than how much the boat could sail, we had little control
- The boat is tough, we launched in the water by throwing it 3 meters above water, without damage.
- The electronics remained perfectly dried
- We forgot the batteries (4AA 1.5V) and we could buy a set of batteries at the corner shop - thatâ€™s a very convenient battery pack.
- The boat was a little too big to take around in public transportation (Hong Kong MTR)


### Hull
- The hull does not curve enough (max 25 degrees)
- There is too much water turbulences between the sections
- Too much buoyancy
- The hull is not hydrodynamic enough
- The boat bows down into the water

### Ballast
- Not hydrodynamic, needs better penetration in water
- Motor (Hull & Sail)
- The amplitude of both hull and sails are too small.

### Sail
- Sail is too small for low wind condition

## Next Step

### Actions for next prototype

- We need to add a piece of audio tape on the top of the mast to know the wind direction and speed
- Boat is needs to be lighter, reduce weight
- Design a ballast that penetrates water better
- Make a hull that curves more
- Avoid space between the section to minimize turbulences
- Reduce buoyancy
- Augment amplitude of hull curving and sail sheeting
- Sharper bow, sharper stern (hull)
- Balance buoyancy front and back
- Add handles to recover and carry around
