## Goal

Protei Mini-RC "Sputnik" is a remotely controlled (radio) modular sailing robot. The design is aimed at being easy to make in most makerspace, low cost, easily extendable. This is NOT a high-performance device and not fit for long-term navigation in the open ocean. This is a small prototype to get acquainted with Protei Shape-Shifting sailing technology, and a fun platform to experiment. If you already own a RC kit (receiver + transmitter) Protei Mini-RC "Sputnik" with 4 modules should definitely cost under 100 USD to build (in San Francisco).

Special thanks to [Autodesk Foundation](http://www.autodesk.org/), [Pier 9](http://www.autodesk.com/artist-in-residence/home) and [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/).

## Specifications

More information can be found on its [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Protei-MIni-RC-Sputnik/)

## Technical

### Modular
The key concept of Protei Sputnik is modularity. Inspired by the Soviet and first-ever satellite, Protei Sputnik is about a new beginning, an impulse.

### Simple & Affordable
Protei Sputnik can be made with affordable materials and by non-professionals.

### 0, 90, 180 Degrees
We tested Protei Sputnik with 4 modules, capable of turning at 90ยบ. To make a 180ยบ turn, we would need 7 modules.

## Observation




## Evaluation

We do not recommend you to build this specific version of Protei as it does not sail very well but you can find instructions on its [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Protei-MIni-RC-Sputnik/).

The truth about developing a new technology is that on the way to have something that works, you produce a lot that doesn't. The Instructables contains all the details of this prototype- what worked, what did not and what we intend to improve. We would love to have your comments!
