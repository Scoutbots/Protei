## Goal





## Specifications



## Technical

The idea comes from the desire to have a transparent hull, made of one folded sheet of polycarbonate, origami style, that would be waterproof, cheap, and easy for anyone to build. It turns out polycarbonate sheets are easy to bend, but really hard to fold. Also any cut on the surface will tear and make the boat leaky.

I found out that it would be easier to cut and weld (using solvent instead of glue) easier than origami. I built an entire hull on a very long strip of PC. It worked out fine. I included 2 aluminium tubes in the structure.
The problem is that with all these cuts, it is no longer watertight. For buoyancy safety reasons, I had to inject foam. Problem with foam : it pushes and distorts the volumes. It was interesting to test the technique, but we might not want to use this technique for manufacturing as foam curing time is long and the process neither economical nor efficient.

This control box is

- symmetrical - read reversible.
- Provide extra support for the mast
- bearings provides much less friction
- the bearings being on the outside of the hull provide greater lever to actuate the hull
- it is transparent, easier to see what is happening - it would be ven better if the box top was transparent too
- there is more space in the box to fit more electronics.
- The cable guides are made a of a low friction plastic (normally used for water fountains) that can be bent without heating.
- There is a switch (not waterproof unfortunately)
- LED to control if the Radio and motors are being “fed”
- The box is relatively easy to build
